League of Legends:  Mastery Calculator
======================================

This project was designed to experiment with the new mastery changes that came
with season 2. It features a very fast interface with fully functional talent
trees that work as you would expect in game. Each point you change will
automatically alter the URL to provide a unique link so that you may share a
build with other players. The calculator does not rely on any server technology,
and thus may be saved and used offline if desired.
